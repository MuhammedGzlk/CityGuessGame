In this game I used python turtle library, pandas library and csv file methods.

First of all, you enter a city name, the name of that city is written on the map
and the name of that city is deleted from the list of cities, and thus the game ends when you know the names of all the cities.



I USED TURKEY MAP FOR THIS PROJECT:
